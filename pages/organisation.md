# Vision
The vision of the pan-European Information Sharing and Analysis Center (PISAX) is
to become a key platform for cooperation on cybersecurity matters between Internet
Exchange Points (IXPs), General Packet Radio Service Roaming eXchange (GRXs)
and professionals or organisations involved in Information security.

# Mission
PISAX’s mission is to promote cybersecurity defence and response within IXPs and
GRXs at the national, European and international level. The mission is conducted
through a) private information sharing within a community of trusted representatives
at member organizations, and b) active role on improving the security of IXPs and
GRXs.

# Objectives
- Improve internal capabilities of IXP/GRX to meet security and reporting
requirements under national laws implementing the NIS Directive
- Facilitate the collaboration on threat intelligence and analysis of technical and
non-technical information about malware and attacks focusing on PISAX
members
- Enable the automatic sharing of indicators of compromise (IoC) by developing
interfaces between PISAX’s members utilising MISP threat sharing platform to
improve the security posture
- Join a European Level Sectoral ISAC to enhance the cross-sectoral sharing

# Governance
PISAX is composed of volunteer members that share the workload of its community
to improve the autonomy capabilities. Every member of the PISAX community can
volunteer to lead the organisation of meetings (e.g. by hosting a meeting
themselves), while ensuring that the host role is rotated to the other members of the
community.

# PISAX operating model
PISAX provides an automated and secure threat intelligence sharing system built on
the open-source MISP threat sharing platform. Given that MISP threat sharing
platform is a mature and popular tool already used by various organisations across
the world, the security and privacy aspects of the PISAX platform is battle tested and
continues to improve due to an active community around it.

# Organisational Policies
The access to PISAX platform is free upon request. The objective is to stimulate
sharing practices among European IXPs/GRXs. Once admitted, PISAX members are
encouraged to respect the operational rules of the MISP threat sharing platform.
