# What is PISAX?

The Action's overall objective is to create a common pan-European Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) to support Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) and General Packet Radio Service Roaming eXchange (GRXs) at the national, European and international level.


IXPs are the infrastructures connecting Internet Service Providers in a country or across countries. GRXs are also connecting network systems but focus on connecting Roaming networks.

The Action will provide an automated and secure threat intelligence sharing system for these entities building on the existing Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) hence improving their current state of security.

The [MISP threat sharing platform](https://www.misp-project.org/) is a free and open source software helping information sharing of threat intelligence including cybersecurity indicators. A threat intelligence platform for gathering, sharing, storing and correlating Indicators of Compromise of targeted attacks, threat intelligence, financial fraud information, vulnerability information or even counter-terrorism information.

The development of the scripts and MISP enhancements will be released in open source. The Action will also improve the beneficiary's cooperation with relevant cybersecurity stakeholders at the national and European level.

# Why?

Information Sharing is becoming a key element to incident response it evolves from simple indicator sharing to advanced threat description. As threat contextualization improves, dedicated sharing communities have appeared. Internet Exchange Point or dedicated IP exchange point (e.g. GRX) are critical to Internet stability PISAX project has the goal to improve the information sharing aspects of IXP/GRXPISAX will allow IX and GRX community to share security information in order to:

 - Help the community facing Cyber-threats
 - Support faster reaction to Europe-wide attacks
 - Facilitate CERT actions
 - Better protect the community
